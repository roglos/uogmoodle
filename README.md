UOGMOODLE
=========
We wont actually store Moodle in this folder as it can be retrieved from the moodle github account directly.

It is planned not to  make any changes to core moodle code at any stage.
Therefore this repository is set up to make use of the Wiki and Issues pages to document installation and development
of Moodle at university of Gloucestershire rather than the core code.

Please make use of the Wiki page for development documentation

Please make use of the Issues page to highlight bugs, enhancements, feature requests or raise queries around the development of Moodle at UoG
